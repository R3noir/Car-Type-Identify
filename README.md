This is a Machine Learning Model that predicts the type of car (Trucks, Bus, Cars and Motorcycles)

This is a low accuracy model with only around 50% to 60% accuracy due to a low training dataset (400 images) from this kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaggleashwin/vehicle-type-recognition)

This model uses Convolutional Neural Network to further optimize the accuracy of the model.
